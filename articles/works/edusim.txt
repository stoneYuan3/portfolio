<p>
	This project is the final project of a Java introduction course. Working individually, I'm asked to develop a simulator of some kind that uses concepts such as object-oriented programming, polymorphism, collision detection and so on.

	The result I developed is a simulator of school life under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. Other than coding, I also made all the visual elements in the project.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
	Although the result is just a mini game, this project gives me a better understanding of object-oriented programming. It also helps me to establish my interest in programming in general, since I do find the process enjoyable.
