		<p>
		This is a hybrid project that include both User Experience design and web development. To complete the project, I researched a client that may need design intervention, figured out a solution for the client, and finally develop the solution.
		</p>

		<p>The client I have chosen is <a href="https://project529.com/garage">529 Garage</a>, a bike database focusing on stopping bike theft. 529 Garage helps people register their bikes to make them easier to recover once stolen.
		</p>
		<p>
		Despite 529 Garage aims to reduce bike theft and encourage bike usage, their solution is not sufficient since it jumps in after the harm is already caused. To better achieve 529 Garageâ€™s goal, something needs to be done to stop bike theft from happening. Which lead to the development part of this project.
		</p>
		<p>
		This project includes an interactive map showing the locations of bike theft reports, as well as locations of bike parking lots as well as their safety measures. This project hopes to give 529 Garage a way to help their users before their bike is stolen by helping bike owners to get better at bike parking when using their bikes.

		<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
			The most valuable part of this project is perhaps the extensive self-learning I took during the process. 
			Building a map-related web application is something that I barely know about when starting this project. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite I know the fundamentals of building a website, I still had to learn additional skills such as embedding a map in a website with a map plugin, working with the map plugin, finding a way to divide the map into sections and interact with those sections, and so on. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite I eventually found working with maps not as challenging as I thought, the fact that I figured it out all by myself give me the confidence to self-learn more challenging topics in the future.

var work_garage_h1='Garage, Artwork Sharing Platform';

		<p>
			This project is the final project of a web development class. Working in a group of three, we are asked to develop a website that displays content, allow users to filter content, allow users to become a member by creating an account, and allow members to have a customized home page.
		</p>
		<p>
			The website we develop is Garage, a fictional artwork-sharing platform inspired by Artstation where people can share their artworks and any random thoughts, follow other people, collect items, and so on. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Considering the different skill levels of my group members, we assigned different roles to each member where one member focused on HTML/CSS layout, one member focused on creating the database and some server-side functionalities, and I focus on server-side development with PHP.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, I was also in charge of integrating my teammate's work, such as editing HTML codes to fit backend settings, and setting up connections between the front end and back end using JQuery AJAX calls. JQuery/AJAX is not necessary for the project, but I want to try some more advanced features.

		<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
			Besides dealing with issues I encountered when developing in a way that is slightly beyond the requirement of this class, this project also taught me a lesson about collaborating with people with different skill levels and expectations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite the class covers JQuery and AJAX call to some extent, it is not required to use those advanced methods. None of my teammates knows how to deal with JQuery. One of them only knows PHP, and one of them is only confident in HTML layout.
		</p>
		<p>
			One takeaway that I have from this interesting situation is that never assume that other people are on the same page as I do. Some conflicts were caused because I assumed that the rest of my team at least understands how JQuery and AJAX call work when distributing the work. This indicates that more communication effort should be made during the planning phase of a group project.
		</p>
		<p>
			The other takeaway comes from the work distribution of this project. In this project, all members contributed to the field they are good at, and one member with a better understanding integrate everything into a whole. This method appears to be a good way to handle skill differences, where I can choose to be the contributor or the integrator depending on my skill level the next time I encounter similar scenarios.

			This project is the final project of a Java introduction course. Working individually, I'm asked to develop a simulator of some kind that uses concepts such as object-oriented programming, polymorphism, collision detection and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			The result I developed is a simulator of school life under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. Other than coding, I also made all the visual elements in the project.

			Although the result is just a mini game, this project gives me a better understanding of object-oriented programming. It also helps me to establish my interest in programming in general, since I do find the process enjoyable.
